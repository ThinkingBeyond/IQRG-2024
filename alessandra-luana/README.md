# Using VQE for Optimising Chemical Problems

This is a study on optimally using VQE algorithms to find the Ground State Energies of molecules. We focused on the hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, because it is well-suited for the current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. Our code is used to find the most optimised ansatz and basis for the algorithm.
