# Understanding Quantum Teleportation

In movies such as Star Trek, we often encounter the idea of teleportation, where an object is transported from one place to another. While this may seem impossible, scientist Charles Bennett and his team demonstrated in 1993 that teleportation is feasible, though not in the manner depicted in movies, but rather in the quantum world.

Quantum teleportation is the process by which a quantum state is transferred from one place to another without traveling through the intervening space. This process is only possible due to quantum entanglement and Bell State measurements. In contrast to its portrayal in movies and TV shows, quantum teleportation does not involve physically teleporting an object; instead, it transfers the quantum information of a qubit.

Quantum teleportation is crucial in quantum networks, as it guarantees secure communication by relying on the fundamentals of quantum mechanics. Moreover, quantum teleportation is integral to Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols, enabling the secure generation of cryptographic keys.

In this research project, the focus is on practical exploration of quantum teleportation through detailed coding.
