# Application of QML to Identify Malicious Login Attempts Based on BETH Dataset
The group members of this project are Basmala Sallam and Menna Zaied, mentored by Mr Jannes Stubbemann. This is part of the competition set by aqora where BETH dataset is utilized for suspicious login detection. 
## What is BETH dataset?
BETH Dataset is an open-source collection of high-quality cybersecurity data specifically curated for anomaly detection research. This rich dataset provides a realistic foundation for developing and testing innovative approaches to cybersecurity challenges. \
You can download BETH dataset from (Aqora)[https://app.aqora.io/competitions/novaceneai-beth/code/template/tree/data] or (kaggle)[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/katehighnam/beth-dataset]
## What is VQC? Why did we choose it?
The variational quantum classifiers (VQC) are quantum circuits that can be trained from labeled data to classify new data samples. \
We chose VQC because: \
1- VQC can handle high-dimensional feature spaces more efficiently. \
2- VQC has been shown to achieve higher accuracy than classical SVM on certain datasets, including those with complex relationships between features. \
3- VQC can capture Non-Linear Scalability. \
4- Quantum parallelism encoding (ZZfeaturemap).
