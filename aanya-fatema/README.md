# Carbon Emissions Forecasting Based On QRNNs

Carbon Emission Forecasting is an important practice for the tracking and prediction of carbon compounds in the atmosphere. The most common carbon compound found is carbon dioxide, which is a greenhouse gas, and one of the main causes for climate change. Carbon Emission Prediction Models (CEPMs) aim to track and predict future levels of carbon emissions, providing a shocking view on the rate at which emissions are increasing. This project aims to prove the accuracy of Quantum Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNNs) over Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) by creating both models, training them with data from 1958 to 2010, and then letting the model predict values from 2012 to 2023. By graphing these predicted values from each model against real measured values from these years we can discern the accuracy of the models. Given the resources, QRNNs could greatly help improve CEPMs.
