# Carbon Footprint Forecasting

Abstract:

This project aims to develop a quantum-enhanced model for carbon footprint forecasting using Quantum Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNNs).
The project evaluates the QRNN model against classical methods, highlighting the potential of quantum computing to address complex environmental challenges and improve carbon management for sustainable development.
