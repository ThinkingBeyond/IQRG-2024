# Usage of VQE and QPE for Chemical Problems 

Classical computers are inefficient in simulating quantum systems such as the atomic structures studied in chemistry. However, using quantum hardware to simulate quantum systems gives good results, for example in finding the Ground State Energy of molecules (GSE).  We used the Variational Quantum Eigensolver(VQE) and Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) in finding the GSE of simple molecules, in our case LiH.
