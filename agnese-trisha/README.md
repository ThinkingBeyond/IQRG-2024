#[Quantum Cryptography - BB84 Protocol]

In our work we focused on implementation of BB84 protocol, the first quantum cryptography one ever created. It was invented in 1984 by Bennett and Brassard and it relies on photon polarisation. We also simulated a eavesdropping scenario, which is based on no-cloning theorem and the fact that a state is altered when measured.
